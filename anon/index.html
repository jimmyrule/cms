        <h1>What is an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC Plan)?</h1>
        <p>An Education, Health & Care Plan or EHCP is a document which sets out the education, health and social care needs of a child or young person aged up to 25, and the support that is necessary to help them achieve their outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Who needs an EHCP?</h2>
        <p>EHC plans are for children and young people (age 0-25) who have a special educational need or disability that cannot be met by the support that is already available at their school or college.</p>
        <p>Most children and young people with special educational needs will have help given to them without the need for an EHC Plan. This is called SEN support.</p>
        <p>The purpose of SEN support is to help children achieve the outcomes or learning objectives that have been set for them.</p>

        <h2>How do I get an EHCP?</h2>
        <p>An EHC plan can only be issued after a child or young person has gone through the process of EHC needs assessment. At the end of that process, the local authority has to make a decision to issue to issue an EHC Plan or not.</p>
